(Max 1000 characters),The project was successful in terms of addressing the physical challenges by meeting targets set for rehabilitation and installing new drainage networks but fell short in terms of addressing the institutional aspects to help scale up the lessons learned under the project.

3,Governance,02-26-16,Lending,Dept,Please share any additional feedback you may have in the box below. (Max 1000 characters),"Project had challenges and as such difficulty in achieving objctives, but also Bank assesment indicators made it difficult to see the good that came out of our engagement on the project. We need to revist assesment process."
4,Water,12-22-15,Lending,Non-Dept,Please share any additional feedback you may have in the box below. (Max 1000 characters),"This was a case of very drawn out preparation, so I have an iffy feeling as to where things will go.  GP seems to have been somewhat inflexible in its approach in a very difficult political economy setting. This problem long predates the GP structure by the way."
5,Education,04-01-16,Lending,Dept,Please share any additional feedback you may have in the box below. (Max 1000 characters),"CMU was very slow in responses - first when delays from client in getting key information meant decision had to be taken on timing of delivery. CMU took more than two weeks (and much follow up) to even come back on decision on extension or not. Similarly when ICR had to be delivered, CMU had the ICR for a week formally and also had a copy when it was sent to client - yet it did not come back with concurrence within the business standards.

7,Social and Urban,03-27-16,Lending,Non-Dept,Please share any additional feedback you may have in the box below. (Max 1000 characters),The design of the LAMP was such that it focus was too narrow and did not get the larger impact that is required for land reform in the Philippines
8,Social and Urban,01-30-16,Lending,Dept,Please share any additional feedback you may have in the box below. (Max 1000 characters),"The project is closed.  It was always run by a country office-based TTL, so the CMU wasn't so much needed to provide local context, but to provide support from the portfolio managment/adminsitrative side.  In my time as TTL that always worked well. Where it could have used some more support was from different sectors (now called GPs).  Everyone was too busy with their own work, however, to make that happen. "

10,Transportation,12-24-15,Lending,Non-Dept,Please share any additional feedback you may have in the box below. (Max 1000 characters),This was a simple single sector project which didn't require much by way of cross GP (or cross CCSA) collaboration. 
11,Governance,06-25-16,Lending,Dept,Please share any additional feedback you may have in the box below. (Max 1000 characters),The task team were all based in country which was very effective. Grateful for support of CMU. The MTDF monitoring and evaluation expert who is part of CMU was key member of the task team. The internal Bank IT expert was given opportunity to gain operational experience on the project and this too worked well.

14,Transportation,06-29-16,Lending,Dept,Please share any additional feedback you may have in the box below. (Max 1000 characters),"The CMUs should focus more on better client engagement rather than criticizing the task teams all the time. Managing the Ministry of Finance is clearly the job of the CMU and not individual task team leaders for their projects. The task teams can focus on line ministries only. It is simply absurd to expect the task teams to manage relationships at Ministry of Finance which is the key responsibility of the CMUs. What happened to the portfolio reviews, now such reviews are being carried out at CMUs convenience and task teams are not even invited to attend rather asked to just provide some inputs to presentations? The CMUs must play their integrating roles and provide a macro level oversight while allowing the task teams to do their job at the micro level."
15,Transportation,12-29-15,Lending,Dept,Please share any additional feedback you may have in the box below. (Max 1000 characters),"During the ICR stage, there was a disagreement among CMU, GP and INT that how much the project-related INT investigation case should be discussed in the ICR, and the ICR team had a hard time to settle the issue in the ICR at the very end of the delivery time.  I hope that IEG, CMU, GP and INT should discuss this issue and make some guidelines for how much INT investigation cases can/should be discussed in the ICR, for the team to avoid having the same confusion every time."
16,Agriculture,06-25-16,Lending,Non-Dept,Please share any additional feedback you may have in the box below. (Max 1000 characters),"This was a complex project taking place in a northern state with governance issues. Half way through the project we became aware of substantial governance issues. The team worked with a new Governor to rectify these issues and to implement as much of the project as possible. The did an excellent job in shepherding this problem project and moving it forward under difficult circumstances, even though the overall outcomes were not those originally anticipated."
17,Trade,12-30-15,Lending,Dept,Please share any additional feedback you may have in the box below. (Max 1000 characters),The CMU has been excellent throughout in dealing with the client and supporting the project. The project involves multiple GPs.

The project however did not perform well and the ICR concluded with an unsatisfactory outcome. However, there is a follow on project that learning from the closed project may help achieve part of the initially intended development outcomes."

This project was implemented under very difficult conditions due to the security and safety issues in Iraq. 2. Despite the client's weak capacity handholding was key to the successful implementation of a most of the activities.3. Frequency of face to face meetings and discussions with the client's political (ministers level) and technical team also contributed to better understanding of the issues, challenges and ways to address them.4. Understanding the local context and constrains as well as speaking the client's language also contributed to the successful implementation of most of the activities.5. Close working relationship and direct communication between the TTL and the country director and country manager was key to over come many of the challenges.6. Full support from the Sector Manager was also key to address the challenges."
24,Water,12-24-15,Lending,Dept,Please share any additional feedback you may have in the box below. (Max 1000 characters),"These questionnaires we get are full of irrelevant one size fits all kinds of questions although they are project specific. This leads to unnecessary transactions and also probably leads to low response rates for most surveys. While we all know management is trying to get the pulse after this massive reorganization, many questionnaires border on being self serving."
25,Agriculture,03-13-16,Lending,Dept,Please share any additional feedback you may have in the box below. (Max 1000 characters),"There is a need to standardize the review and approval process across GPs regarding the GP director's approval of the ICRs. This is a new, additional step that has added to the preparation process of the ICR and the whole quality assurance process remains unclear."

27,Water,06-26-16,Lending,Dept,Please share any additional feedback you may have in the box below. (Max 1000 characters),"This project was implemented in an area affected by conflict and security problems.  Because of the security issues, colleagues from procurement and financial management were changed frequently as they were not happy to be traveling to Quetta, so, whenever they get a chance to opt out the missions, they did, and the project suffered as only new comers and inexperienced people were given the task to go there and to perform.  The experienced ones were often sending their consultants to do the mission on their behalf.  Same was applied to the assigned environmental specialist who never travel there and the young consultant he hired had to go...The Social development specialist from 2010 unit 2014 did not travel even once to the Quetta.  He tried but the flight was postponed and he did not go despite the fact that the project had large Resettlement Component.  "
28,Water,12-16-15,Lending,Non-Dept,Please share any additional feedback you may have in the box below. (Max 1000 characters),"Long standing problem. A recent change in TTL seems to have had good impact. Prior to that, this was a classic case of a project that simply did not move and a team that continued claiming everything was fine."
29,Water,06-24-16,Lending,Dept,Please share any additional feedback you may have in the box below. (Max 1000 characters),I got very good support from CMU. that made possible to submit the project in time. I didn't seek support from CCSA and other GPs. But both fiduciary and safeguards' support was vital. Legal help was also very good and timely. They also supported me very well on international water safeguard issues and in seeking exception of VP for that.best regards Srinivas
30,Transportation,06-26-16,Lending,Dept,Please share any additional feedback you may have in the box below. (Max 1000 characters),This is a problem project because of difficulties within the implementation agency and at this stage there is little the Bank can do.
31,Agriculture,12-31-15,Lending,Dept,Please share any additional feedback you may have in the box below. (Max 1000 characters),Stupid survey
32,Agriculture,12-31-15,Lending,Non-Dept,Please share any additional feedback you may have in the box below. (Max 1000 characters),This was a diificult case.  The GP has since changed the team composition to address the CMU's concerns. I am hopeful things will bebetter now.

34,Env,06-29-16,Lending,Dept,Please share any additional feedback you may have in the box below. (Max 1000 characters),TTL has conducted country dialogue for entire duration of project. Resources for supervision were limited and the project team was reduced to the TTL and required fiduciary and safeguards staff. 
35,Social and Urban,12-30-15,Lending,Dept,Please share any additional feedback you may have in the box below. (Max 1000 characters),I was only TTL for the ICR and clousure of the projekt. 
36,Energy,06-25-16,Lending,Dept,Please share any additional feedback you may have in the box below. (Max 1000 characters),World Bank's support for development of Hydro is very important and also well appreciated by clients. Hydro projects require long preparation time and more than normal level of resources (funds as well as manpower). Even though risks are high the rewards are also high and long term positive development impacts are significant (assuming the projects are prepared and implemented in a socially and environmentally sustainable manner). It would be good if internally the staff are encouraged and given space to take up such high risk projects and the incentive system is aligned accordingly.
37,Social and Urban,09-11-16,Lending,Dept,Please share any additional feedback you may have in the box below. (Max 1000 characters),CMU has shown strong willingness to support the activity and provided guidance on time on issues that have cropped up.

(Max 1000 characters),"The CMU was largely absent in the ROC deliberations, but we got great support from the MNA Chief Economist.  Subsequent to the operation, the Egyptian government received a number of complaints from bidders that we had not included a domestic prefrence clause in the advanced procurement packages worth $150 million.  In countries with high unemployment, we should recommended such clauses in the procurement plan prior to their approval.  While the procurement team is of the view that such a clause would barely make an impact on outcomes, it could have in this case, and may provide political cover for our clients facing such criticisms.  "
39,Health,06-24-16,Lending,Non-Dept,Please share any additional feedback you may have in the box below. (Max 1000 characters),This project has been in problem status for some time.

43,Governance,07-16-16,Lending,Dept,Please share any additional feedback you may have in the box below. (Max 1000 characters),"Need to streamline processes leading to CMU's role on providing support to TTLs to better serve clients on project restructurings. In particular, there are two key areas of opportunity on the CMU side: (1) reduce clearance response times throughout a multi-staged project restructuring process; and (2) embrace a client oriented stance by engaging on dialogue with counterparts on the ground during project restructuring, especially in those cases when restructuring process time from the Bank side is taking much longer than expected. To streamline Bank's processes on project restructuring, I propose to undertake a sort of ""forensic audit"" on IBTAL's recent restructuring process leading to analyze point- to- point the whole process to  identify those bottlenecks and windows of opportunity (starting from any from the TTL side) both from the operational and client dialogue perspective, with the aim of assessing possible ways to better serve clients.

48,Social and Urban,04-01-16,Lending,Dept,Please share any additional feedback you may have in the box below. (Max 1000 characters),"This survey is very poorly worded.The first set of questions assume that the GP has no country knowledge, flies in from DC, while the CMU sits in-country and has all country knowledge. This is not only inconsistent with the Bank's decentralization policy, it is really not the case. Country context knowledge lies with individuals that have been in-country for some time, irrespective of their mapping, and relationships to counterparts are built up over time and often through projects, and rely on LRS. They rarely rely on the CMU counterparts (normally the Ministry of Finance) and the CMU is often asking the GP staff for support to make contacts in sectors, and not the other way around.Moreover support from a Country Manager can be highly dependent on their skill base.  Not all country managers can engage well in all sectors.The questions in this survey are the wrong questions."

(Max 1000 characters),"Overall a strong team, with passion and with strong delivery - very positive. Message from CMU to team:  more evidence based analysis earlier on can be important to help develop strong counterpart ownership.  The team took this lesson to heart, after an initial focus on advocacy."
50,Water,05-08-16,Lending,Non-Dept,Please share any additional feedback you may have in the box below. (Max 1000 characters),"The project is the best that can be designed in the given high risk context, so the low rating of development outcomes is not a reflection of the team.  The Governance GP should have been involved, but did not provide inputs on time, thus the low rating of cross GP collaboration"

52,Governance,04-28-16,Lending,Non-Dept,Please share any additional feedback you may have in the box below. (Max 1000 characters),"This project was approved in 2010 as a flagship for the Brazil program and tried a new, innovative structure -- what we call in Brazil a multisector Sector-wide approach. It has a transversal public sector component that worked to support better service delivery in education, health, transport and private sector development.  (For full disclosure, I was the original co-TTL with Jose Guilherme Reis). The networks at the time worked very closely together --also with the operatinal groups --  to create the right structure of incentives within the project and it has proven a very popular approach in Brazil: highly customized with a focus on results and support during implementation.  It was one of the projects that helped inspire the P4R instrument. Since the organizational restructuring the project has completed implementation of TA -- the great majority of the project was completed under the old structure."
53,Governance,04-28-16,Lending,Dept,Please share any additional feedback you may have in the box below. (Max 1000 characters),Since this operation started seven years ago and has now closed (we are finalizing the ICR) none of the questions is really relevant. However my overall view is that in most projects the GPs are tending to act disconnected from the CMUs and seem to have little sense of the importance of the client and country relations. This is something which urgently needs to be fixed in the operating model.
54,Education,01-29-16,Lending,Dept,Please share any additional feedback you may have in the box below. (Max 1000 characters),CMU role during supervision is minimal. CMU role during ICR left much to be desired. They participated in QER and had the ICR which they could have reviewed over a month before it was finaly sent for clearances. Yet on the last few days the Senior Country Officer provided extensive comments which not only did not add value but substantially increased the transactions costs associated with getting the ICR cleared and out in a timely manner. 
55,Social and Urban,08-03-16,Lending,Non-Dept,Please share any additional feedback you may have in the box below. (Max 1000 characters),"This was an extremely difficult project to implement, and closed with few successes.

58,Labor,12-29-15,Lending,Dept,Please share any additional feedback you may have in the box below. (Max 1000 characters)," I think the mechanisms and incentives for cross-GP collaboration are yet to function, partly for the reason that people feel comfortable working in silos (could be the organisational culture) or used to of incentives where the strength of GP is determined by the number of lending programs it is managing. I feel that compared to previous model, there is less of interaction between the GPs senior management and the CMUs, partly for the reson that the CMUs continue to work as ""regions"" whereas the GPs are now functioning as ""global"". For Senior Directors and Directors, a CMU in a country is ""one of many"" whereas the Practice Manager has no more easy access to Director level support as they used to have to resolve issues with the VPUs-- by leveraging the previous VP modl.  As staff, we now look at only one person i.e. the PM to resolve all outstanding issues."

If we want to achieve results on the  field (in this case the development outcomes) and you have several TTLs in charge of one project during the project life at the end any of the TTLs is going to be responsible for the results achieve or not achieve. And we know that from practice and science, accountability is weaken when share by a group.Suggestion: To have (ideally) only one TTL for the live of the Project (or the minimum possible) that way he/she will be accountable/recognize for the results achieve or not.

Regarding cross-GP coordination. Soon after the establishment of the GPs, a critical locally-based team member from another GP informed the TTL that his practice manager had asked him not to work this project anymore. This was very disruptive as this team member had been involved in the project for a long time, his role in the team involved frequent travel to the project sites and there was no replacement for his skills in the country. It took several months and my GP PM talking to with his GP PM to sort out this issue so he could stay in the team."

(Max 1000 characters),"The CMU have been trying to actively engage and support the project, but the parallel lines of communication with the client has resulted in confusion. The project is listed as a problem project and so the CMU instituted a series of parallel reporting requirements to track procurement processes, disbursements etc. The responsibility for reporting on these fell on the TTL, taking away from other tasks and imposing additional burdens on the client and taking away time that may have been better spent addressing the problems with the project itself.Procurement has become less a part of the team and more of an external oversight mechanism,issuing instructions rather than providing solutions and proactively engaging to support the team and the client. The strict applciation of systems like PROCYS creates a linear process that creates unnecessary delays, requires TTLs to be in the office and on the system as opposed to spending time with the client and on the issues.

Tedency to move to have multiple co-TTLs per task with unclear responsibility assignments rather than improving the availability of task team members for a given task with multi speciality analytic support could be counterproductive unless carefully moderated.

Within this environment it is very difficult for the GFARD CMU staff to cultivate the strong relationship with MOA which is needed to achieve policy reform.

This was a waste of time due to the lack of communication between the FSAP Unit and the CMU. This (as with so many other issues in the WB) has less to do with the structure and organization of the WB, and more to do with the quality of our managers.

The CMU was also instrumental in requesting the inclusion of a contingent emergency response sub-component in the project and the inclusion of disaster risk preparedness technical assistance.

In very concrete terms: GP's teams are still delivering what THEY want to deliver, not what was very clearly stated that should be delivered. GP's seem to be thriving in the comfort of delivering the contributions on time, regardless of the quality and content depth of their contributions. This is not right. And I am not sure the Bank has an internal system to control for it and correct it."

We got a lot more recognition from outside than Bank than we did from inside the Bank about this important piece.  "

From this we were able to develop some draft manuals and are currently working to finalize others.

(Max 1000 characters),"We would appreciate more focused support from the Fiduciary and Safeguard services. In disaster response project the speed of processing matters and my assessment is the fiduciary and safeguard units are highly understaffed.Another point is that the task team needs to adjust (create space in) its ongoing work program to deliver the disaster response projects. However, in reality what happens is that the task team members try to adjust the additional demand in their work program. As a result many a times the full task team is not available for preparation/assessment mission. Some members even miss the important discussions such as decision meeting, etc."

There is no need for cumbersome process review and approval.  No need in my view for a director approval.  Manager approval is enough.  Director could be copied.  No need for review of concept note.  Simple TOR is enough.  Requirement in the system should be simplified when output is just a workshop or a regional forum.  May be a simple form in the system be created specifically for workshops/conferences.  Let us make it simple process wise.

(Max 1000 characters),"Dealing with the bureaucratic WBG processes continue to require an inordinate amount of time from the TTL.  For a TTL in a GP working across all regions, the processes continue to be different for every region, and indeed, different in every country.  Greater harmonization and simplification of processes is desparately needed.  Finding out who the correct individual for the ADM processes for this simple sub-task required approximately 20 hours of TTL time."
532,Education,05-18-16,Non Lending,Dept,Please share any additional feedback you may have in the box below. (Max 1000 characters),"PMs and their teams had to make special effort to maintain good relations with CMUs in order to ensure timely and quality delivery to our clients and to shield the client from the dynamics of the ongoing reform which was sometimes stressful. Support for quality assurance and safeguards were probably the weakest areas this FY. Also, RVPs continued to demand the same degree of allegiance from PMs making the life of a PM so much more difficult.I also want to use this opportunity to say that it is not enough to base span of control only on number of staff under a manager. We should also include other factors such as (i) number of countries; (ii) capacity of the clients. Managing a program in a region with a number of countries with good capacity on the ground (e.g. East Asia) is very different from managing a region with lots of FCV countries."
